# CoffeeCupApiAccess
A .NET core library for accessing the CoffeeCup API.

# Summary
We are using [CoffeeCupApp](https://www.coffeecupapp.com) for time tracking on our projects. Luckily the team from CoffeeCup provides an API. The (CoffeeCup API documentation)[https://bitbucket.org/coffeecupapp/api_docs]  is pretty good and so we have writte a .NET core wrapper to enable other to access it easily.
